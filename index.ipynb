    "\n",
    "In this section we will be moving on to a second unsupervised learning technique: Clustering! Clustering techniques are very powerful when you want to group data with similar characteristics together, but have no pre-specified labels. The main goal of clustering is to create clusters that have a high similarity between the data belonging to one cluster, while aiming at in a low similarity between clusters.  \n",

    "### K-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by providing a basic intuition of the K-Means Clustering algorithm. When using the K-Means clustering algorithm, the number of clusters which you want to obtain is specified upfront, and the algorithm aims at the most \"optimal\" cluster centers given that there are K clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "A second branch of clustering algorithms is hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Using hierarchical clustering, unlike K-Means clustering, you don't decide on the number of clusters beforehand. Instead, you start with $n$ clusters were $n$ is the number of datapoints, and at each step, join 2 clusters. You stop joining clusters when a certain criterion is used.\n",

    "### Market Segmentation with Clustering\n",

    "A very common and useful application of clustering is market segmentation. You'll practice your clustering skills on a market segmentation data set! \n",

    "### Semi-Supervised Learning\n",
